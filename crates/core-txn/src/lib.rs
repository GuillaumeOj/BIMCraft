//! Commands: every change to a `BIMCraft` model is a serialisable [`Command`], so history,
//! macros, replay and collaboration share one mechanism (CORE-11).
//!
//! This crate builds for native targets and `wasm32-unknown-unknown` (ARCH-01) and never touches
//! the platform directly (ARCH-02).

// ARCH-02: forbid, not deny, so nothing in this crate can opt out. See docs/dev/quality.md.
